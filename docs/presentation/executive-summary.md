# Safety Net OpenAPI Toolkit
## Executive Summary

### The Problem

Building technology for safety net programs is challenging. Each state has different terminology, program names, and requirements. Development teams waste time reinventing solutions, integration between systems is slow and error-prone, and organizations often become locked into specific vendors' proprietary systems.

### The Solution

The Safety Net OpenAPI Toolkit provides **pre-built, shared API definitions for benefits eligibility programs**. Instead of starting from scratch, teams build on a common foundation that captures core concepts—applications, households, income, eligibility—while allowing for state-specific customization.

### Key Capabilities

- **Shared API Definitions** — Ready-to-use specifications for common benefits data, built on industry standards that any vendor can implement
- **Simulated APIs** — Fully functional test environments generated automatically, enabling frontend development without waiting for backend systems
- **Ready-to-Use Code Libraries** — Pre-built integration code that catches errors early and speeds up development
- **State Customizations** — Adapt the shared definitions for each state's terminology and requirements without duplicating work
- **One-Command API Creation** — Define a new data type once, and automatically get a complete API with documentation, test environment, and code libraries

### Benefits

| For | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Development Teams** | Start building immediately; consistent patterns reduce bugs and ramp-up time |
| **Program Managers** | Faster delivery; reduced coordination overhead between teams |
| **States & Agencies** | Customizable for local requirements; no vendor lock-in since any provider can implement the shared definitions |

### How It Works

1. Teams start with pre-built API definitions for common benefits data
2. State-specific customizations adapt terminology and requirements
3. Documentation, test environments, and code libraries are generated automatically
4. Backend teams implement against clear specifications with automated verification
5. Improvements to the shared foundation benefit all participating states
