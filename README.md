# Safety Net OpenAPI Toolkit

This toolkit helps teams build consistent, well-documented APIs for safety net programs—enabling faster integration between benefits systems and reducing the technical barriers to improving service delivery.

## About This Repository

This is an evolving repository where Code for America stores integrated benefits API specifications for the different states we work with. The specifications are built on a common data model that captures the core concepts shared across safety net programs—applications, households, income, eligibility—while allowing for state-specific variations in terminology, program names, and data requirements.

## Getting Started

Choose your path based on your role:

| Role | You want to... | Start here |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Design APIs, validate specs, test backend implementations | [Backend Developer Guide](./docs/getting-started/backend-developers.md) |
| **Frontend Developer** | Build UIs against the APIs, use generated clients | [Frontend Developer Guide](./docs/getting-started/frontend-developers.md) |

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install

# Set your state
export STATE=california

# Start mock server + Swagger UI
npm start
```
